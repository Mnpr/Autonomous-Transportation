## Perception

- Static Objects 
  - on-route [ e.g. Road, Lane markings ]'
  - off-route [ e.g. Curbs, boundaries of operations, Traffic Lights, Signs( road, construction, obstruction etc.) ]
- Dynamic Objects
  - Vehicles
  - Other moving systems in sorrounding
- Ego localization
  - Position
  - Velocity, Acceleration
  - Orientation, Angular motion

### Challenges of Perception

- Data Collection on different operational condition
- Robust detection and segmentation
- Sensor Uncertainty
- Occlusion, Reflection, Weather conditions ( camera, lidar )
- Redundant sensors [ to overcome limitation of individual sensors ] ( e.g. radar immune to weather conditions )
