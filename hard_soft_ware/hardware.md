# Hardware

- Sensor data processing

- Computing and Inference of Computer Vision models ( segmentation, object detection and mapping )

- GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs

- Sychronization Hardware modules with common clock

- Sensor measurements must be timestamped with consistent times for sensor fusion.

## Hardware design configuration

- Sensor coverage requirements for different scenarios
  
  - Scenario A
  
  - Scenario B

- Blind Spots, Design issues, overall coverage

### Coverage

**Assumption**

- Agressive decelerations = 5 $m/s^{2}$

- Comfortable deceleration = 2 $m/s^{2}$

- Stopping distance $d = \frac{v^{2}}{2a}$ [ V - velocity, a - deceleration rate]

**Sensor Placement**

- Sensor supporting maneuvers within the ODD [ Operational Design Domain ]

- Traffifc speed, volume, #of lanes, etc.
