# Autonomous Transportation

Autonomous Transportation can be seen as composition of following domains.
- Perception of the Environment
- Motion Planning [ A -2-> B ]
- Vehicle Control
- Operational Design Domain( ODD ) [ operating condition and environment ]

## Tasks for Autonomous Driving

- Lateral Control [ <- steering -> ]
- Longitudinal Control [ braking, acceleration ]
- Object and Event Detection and Response( OEDR ) [ Detection & Reaction ]
  - Automatic emergency response
  - Driver Supervision ?
- Motion Planning [ Long | Short term ]
- Miscellaneous [ Indicators and Signals ]


## Levels of Autonomy [1.]

0. `Level 0` No Automation

1. `Level 1` Driving Assistance [ Either Lateral or Logitudinal Control ]
   - e.g. Adaptive Cruise Control [ speed control with supervised steering ]
   - e.g. Lane Keeping Assistance( Cars. ) [ lateral centering with lane detection ]

2. `Level 2` Partial Driving Automation  [ Both Lateral & Longitudinal Control ]
   - e.g. GM Super Cruise, Nissan ProPilot Assist

3. `Level 3` Conditional Driving Automation [ Level2 + some degree of OEDR ] ( unsupervised by driver only in conditional scenarios ) 

4. `Level 4` High Driving Automation [ Level3 + automatic emergency response ] ( limited ODD )

5. `Level 5` High Driving Automation [ Level4 + Unlimited ODD ]
